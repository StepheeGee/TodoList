The code was organized in this manner to achieve several key objectives and to adhere to certain programming principles:

Modularity and Reusability:

Functions like createQuestionElement, showQuestion, goToNextQuestion, and goToPreviousQuestion encapsulate specific tasks. This promotes code reuse and maintainability. Each function handles a specific aspect of the questionnaire logic, making it easier to modify or extend the code in the future.
Separation of Concerns:

Each function focuses on a specific task or responsibility, such as creating HTML elements, displaying questions, or handling navigation. This separation of concerns makes the code more understandable and easier to debug.
Event-Driven Approach:

Utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions (button clicks, form submissions). This aligns with an event-driven programming model, where actions are triggered by events, enhancing user interactivity.
Dynamic Questionnaire Generation:

The code dynamically generates the questionnaire structure based on the questionsData array. This approach allows flexibility in adding or modifying questions without directly hardcoding HTML.
Conditional Logic for Button Display:

The use of conditional statements (if) controls the display of buttons based on the current position in the questionnaire. This ensures that appropriate buttons (Back, Next, Submit) are shown at the right time, enhancing user experience and guiding navigation.
Preventing Default Form Submission:

The formSubmitHandler function prevents the default form submission behavior, enabling custom navigation control within the questionnaire.
Logical Flow Control:

The code maintains a logical flow from displaying questions to handling user input and navigation. Functions like goToNextQuestion and goToPreviousQuestion manage the progression through the questionnaire, maintaining a smooth user experience.
